  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <img class="profile-img" src="http://jennyy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/jennyphoto.jpg">
  <p>I'm a new Thinkful student looking to brush up on my skills. I used to work at a non-profit exchange organization. I eventually changed gears and went back to school to study multimedia design and web development. For the last 7 odd years I've worked at digital and marketing
    agencies on various web and email projects.</p>
  <p>
    I'm a thoughtful and resourceful person with a mind for creative problem-solving. And I love to understand how things work. That's why I chose to pursue this career.</p>
  <p>Continuing to learn is important to me. I can't be happy without a little challenge. At any given point, I have at least a couple projects brewing.</p>

  <h2>Where are you from?</h2>
  <p>I was born and reared in the Willamette Valley, Oregon. I live in Portland now. I've spent some time in other places in the Pacific Northwest. Vancouver (BC), Olympia and San Juan Island are all dear to my heart.</p>

  <h2>More about me</h2>
  <h3>What are your favorite hobbies?</h3>
  <p>I've always got myself busy with some kind of arts 'n' crafts project. For example, I took a dyeing workshop last weekend and this weekend I'm woodblock printing. I also enjoy sewing, gardening, hiking, and mushroom-hunting. Sometimes you'll see me
    looking scared on a skateboard or asleep at the movies.</p>

  <h3>What's your dream job?</h3>
  <p>Is there a job that involves frontend and some combination of my hobbies? That's my dream. So, I think I'll have to start my own business...selling crafts made out of mushrooms...online.</p>

  <h3>What music have you been listening to lately?</h3>
  <p>Currently listening to Dead Moon. I like some of all sorts but as I get older, I find myself sticking with the same old stuff. </p>
